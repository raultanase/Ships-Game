# Ships-Game
The program is based on the creation of game boards, where the player's ships will be placed, as well as those of the computer. The strategy of the game is to hit one of the 4 points in the construction of a ship, and then you have to look for the whole ship to bring it down. On 3 such ships shot down by one of the competitors, the game ends.
